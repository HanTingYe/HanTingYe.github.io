Hi! I am Hanting Ye, and you can call me *Damon* as well. I am currently a PostDoc Researcher supervised by <a href="https://www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/qing/" target="_blank">Prof. Qing Wang</a> at the [Embedded Systems (ES) Group](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/software-technology/embedded-systems/) of the Computer Science Department, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, and Computer Science (EEMCS), [Delft University of Technology (TU Delft)](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/), The Netherlands. I also closely work with <a href="https://guohao.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Prof. Guohao Lan</a>. I am also a [Marie-Curie PhD Fellow](https://enlightem.eu/people/damon-ye/) at Project [ENLIGHTEM-MSCA](https://enlightem.eu/).

### Research interests

I am passionate about new technologies and applications that arise from revolutionary changes in the physical world. My doctoral dissertation, titled *Through-Screen Computing,* explores the advent of transparent screens and their growing prevalence in mobile devices. I mainly develop and implement novel machine learning and signal processing algorithms into mobile systems to address the unique challenges transparent screens present to existing applications and to foster innovative new uses. Moving forward, I will focus on harnessing transparent screen technology to enhance AR/VR applications—such as AR glasses—and to realize spatial intelligence.
